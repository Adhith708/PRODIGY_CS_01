# PRODIGY_CS_01 
# Caesar Cipher Program

This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform the operations.

# Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserve non-alphabetic characters in the message.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adhith708/caesar-cipher.git

### Navigation To Project Directory

-cd caesar-cipher

### Run The Program

-python caesar_cipher.py

### Example

-Suppose lets take "hi how are you " as the plane text  

Encryption

-Caesar Cipher Program

-Would you like to (E)ncrypt, (D)ecrypt, or (Q)uit? e

-Enter your message: hi how are you

-Enter the shift value (0-25): 20

-Encrypted message: bc biq uly sio

Decryption

-Would you like to (E)ncrypt, (D)ecrypt, or (Q)uit? d

-Enter your message: bc biq uly sio

-Enter the shift value (0-25): 20

-Decrypted message: hi how are you

-Would you like to (E)ncrypt, (D)ecrypt, or (Q)uit? q

-Goodbye!
